# Data_Mining_Project

This project was made in Kotlin programming language using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE. In order to run, after you open the project with a Kotlin IDE, you need to:
- modify the file src/main/kotlin/Main.kt, there are 3 variables to identify some paths: indexPath, wikiepdiaDirectory and questionsFile. Change these according to your project location (each directory or file already exists within the Kotlin project, the problem is with the path to the project; couldn't specify a path relative to the project because of different OS)
- in the file Main.kt, click on Run Main.kt
- a menu with the options will be displayed, enter the number of option
