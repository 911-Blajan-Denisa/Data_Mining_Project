# Data_Mining_Project

This project was made in Kotlin programming language using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE. In order to run, you need to have the following:
 - IntelliJ IDEA installed
 - use a version of Java >= 19
 - open the folder as an IntelliJ Project and wait for it to load
- modify the file src/main/kotlin/Main.kt, there are 3 variables to identify some paths: indexPath, wikiepdiaDirectory and questionsFile. Change these according to your project location (each directory or file already exists or it will be created within the Kotlin project, the problem is with the path to the project; couldn't specify a path relative to the project for the 3 files/folders because of different OS)
- in the file src/main/kotlin/Main.kt, click on Run Main.kt button 
- a menu with the options will be displayed on the console, enter the number of option

You can either create the index (it will take about 3 to 5 minutes) or you can downloaded it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kCe_kGej6Lp9rKOEPNhzOeBegjGeleLZ) and copy all the files inside the path you specified.
